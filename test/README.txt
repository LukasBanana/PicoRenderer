The CMake file will generate a test project for your OS (if supported).
Set the working directory to this folder
(e.g. "C:/Users/YourUserName/PicoRenderer/test/" on Windows,
or "/home/YourUserName/PicoRenderer/test/" on a Posix system).
Otherwise the resources from "test/media/" will not be loaded by the application.
